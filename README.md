## Installing / Getting started

Please notice that there is both a .docx file and the main function. The .docx file is for the SQL answers. 

```shell
packagemanager install awesome-project
awesome-project start
awesome-project "Do something!"  # prints "Nah."
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

### Initial Configuration

Some projects require initial configuration (e.g. access tokens or keys, `npm i`).
This is the section where you would document those requirements.

## Developing

the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hammy414/Luhn-Algorithm/import_string.py
cd awesome-project/
packagemanager install
```
