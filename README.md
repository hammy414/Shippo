# Shippo TSE Challange For Joshua Sternfeld

> Additional information or tagline

The shippo TSE challange for Joshua Sternfeld - TSE

## Installing / Getting started

Please notice that there is both a .docx file and the main function. The .docx file is for the SQL answers. 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hammy414/shippo
main.py start
```

The main.py file will show you your shipment info. If you want to change package information, please edit the file to do so. 

### Initial Configuration

This project I created pulls from a private isolated token. What you need to do is to create a new python file in the same directory called "shippo_secrets". After that create a method on that new file called "test_api_key= "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY"".

I have included a blank shippo_secrets file for you to use a template.
